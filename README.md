# Introduction
This expansion board is designed specifically for micro:bit. It is 90 degrees with micro:bit, which is more stereoscopic after insertion. Compared with the traditional horizontal expansion board, this expansion version is more suitable for DIY robots, cars and other works. The three-dimensional shape makes the micro:bit face to you.
The micro:bit expansion board integrates two high-power RGB colorful searchlights and three SMD RGB programming lights. The 5 LED lights are all brightly lit, and the lighting effect is cool in a dark environment.
It can drive 3 5V servos, easy to play with robots and many other experiments. It can also drive 2 3V DC motors, and easily experiment with small fans/smart cars.
A passive buzzer is integrated on the expansion board, and the buzzer can be programmed to play various songs and music. Of course, you can use our APP to perform a remote piano playing.
The expansion board is powered by a 500mAh high-capacity lithium battery, and the charging process can be easily completed by connecting the expansion board via a USB cable. In addition, we also designed multiple protection circuits: over-discharge protection, over-charge protection, and reverse-connection protection.
The expansion board integrates an infrared ranging pair tube, a high-precision tracking probe, and an ultrasonic module interface. This makes it easy to transform the entire expansion board into a smart car chassis for a micro:bit smart car.
The expansion board provides three kinds of communication interfaces: IIC, SPI, serial communication, easy to expand PS2 controller, Bluetooth module and other external devices. In addition, we have reserved 5 IO ports, which are led out by pin headers, so you can expand your sensor usage.
